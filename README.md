## Dexcom menubar

This Python script is a plugin for [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/) that allows you to pull recent blood glucose values from [Dexcom Share](https://www.dexcom.com/training-videos/setting-up-dexcom-share-and-follow) and display them in the Mac menubar:

The design is based heavily on the [Nightscout](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor#nightscout-web-monitor-aka-cgm-remote-monitor)-based menubar apps by [Mark Wilson](https://github.com/mddub/nightscout-osx-menubar) and [Michael Pangburn](https://github.com/mpangburn/NightscoutMenuBar). 

### Prerequisites:

* A working Python 3 installation.  While Python is no longer included by default with the Mac OS, you can install it from the Xcode command-line tools, [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
* The [pydexcom](https://github.com/gagebenne/pydexcom) package.  Install it with `pip3 install pydexcom`. 
* A working Dexcom Share setup that is uploading your blood glucose values (or those of someone who has given you access to their data) to the cloud. 

### To install:
